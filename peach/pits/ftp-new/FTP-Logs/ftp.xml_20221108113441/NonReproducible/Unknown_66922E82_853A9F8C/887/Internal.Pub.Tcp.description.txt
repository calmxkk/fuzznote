This usually means the device/software under test:

 1. Crashed or exited during testing
 2. Overwhelmed and could not respond correctly 
 3. In an invalid state and non responsive 
 4. Had just restarted and was unable to process the request 

This can happen during testing when a series of test cases cause the 
target service to misbehave or even crash.
